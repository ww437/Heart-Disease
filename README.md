## Overview
This project aims to harness the potential of machine learning algorithms to predict and prevent heart disease by deciphering patterns within a dataset that encompasses various risk factors, including age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. Our approach involves comprehensive data analysis to uncover correlations and develop robust predictive models. By evaluating the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms, we seek to enhance our understanding of heart disease risk factors and empower early intervention, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.
